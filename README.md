# PhoneBook

## Description

This is a simple phone book application that enables you to perform actions such as adding, editing, deleting, and
searching for contacts.  
It is built using Symfony 6.3.8 and React 18.  
The application employs PostgreSQL 15.5 as its database, which can be accessed through Adminer
at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) using the following credentials:

|   System   |  Server  |    Username     |    Password     | Database  |
|:----------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| PostgreSQL | database | _your username_ | _your password_ | phonebook |

## Usage
